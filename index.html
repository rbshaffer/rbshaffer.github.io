  <p>I'm a PhD candidate in Government at the University of Texas at Austin, specializing in public law and methodology. I study comparative statutory design and policy discourse. Starting in Fall of 2018, I'll be joining Beth Simmons's Borders and Boundaries in World Politics group at <a href="https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse" target="_blank">Perry World House</a> as a postdoctoral fellow.</p>

  <p>In most countries, preferences and institutional rules are expressed in legal documents, such as laws, administrative regulations, and constitutions. Unfortunately, legal language is difficult to interpret, both for experts and for the public. I use computational tools to unlock the information contained in these texts.</p>
