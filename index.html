  <p>I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's <a href="https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse" target="_blank">Perry World House</a>, working with Beth Simmons' Borders and Boundaries in World Politics group. I received a PhD in Government and an MS in Statistics and Data Science from the University of Texas at Austin.

  <p>Broadly, I study formal institutional design and surrounding policy discourse. In most countries, policy programs and institutional rules are expressed in legal documents, such as laws and constitutions. Unfortunately, legal language is difficult to read and interpret. I use machine learning and computational linguistics tools to unlock the information contained in these texts.</p>
