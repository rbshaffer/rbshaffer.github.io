  <p>I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University. I received a PhD in Government and an MS in Statistics and Data Science from the University of Texas at Austin.

  <p>Broadly, I study formal institutional design, both within and beyond the United States. Legal documents - such as laws, constitutions, or treaties - often contain institutional rules, which describe who can do what, when, and to whom. Unfortunately, dense legal texts are difficult for non-experts to interpret. In my work, I use machine learning and natural language processing methods to unlock the information contained in these documents, which allows me to study the political and policy origins of formal institutional design choices. </p>

  <p>My research has been published in <i>Political Analysis</i> and the <i>Journal of Politics</i>, among other outlets.</p>
