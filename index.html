  <p>I'm a PhD candidate in Government at the University of Texas at Austin, specializing in public law and methodology. Starting in Fall of 2018, I'll be joining Beth Simmons's Borders and Boundaries in World Politics group at <a href="https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse" target="_blank">Perry World House</a> as a postdoctoral fellow.</p>

  <p>Broadly, I study formal institutional design and surrounding policy discourse. In most countries, policy programs and institutional rules are expressed in legal documents, such as laws and constitutions. Unfortunately, legal language is difficult to read and interpret. I use machine learning and computational linguistics tools to unlock the information contained in these texts.</p>
