<p>Many of my most fulfilling experiences in graduate school have come through my involvement in the <a href="http://www.comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/" target="_blank">Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP)</a>. As a member of the CCP team, I helped to build <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/" target="_blank">Constitute</a>, a search and visualization tool powered by CCP's data on the world's founding texts. I also helped to build a series of visualizations related to the project, which were displayed online and on-site at the <a href="http://billofrights.constitutioncenter.org/rights-interactive/constitutional-rights-origins-and-travels/" target="_blank">National Constitution Center</a> in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>You can find links to several of these projects in-text and through the pictures below. For information about ongoing work, please feel free to get in touch!</p>
