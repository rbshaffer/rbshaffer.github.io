<p>Many of my most fulfilling experiences in graduate school have come through my involvement in projects with impacts beyond the academic domain. During the summer of 2017, I worked with the <a href="http://vitalsigns.org/" target="_blank">Vital Signs</a> team at Conservation International on a number of analyses relating agricultural productivity, environmental resilience, and economic outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Results from our primary project - a predictive model of water insecurity events in Tanzania, Ghana, Rwanda, and Uganda - is available through the Vital Signs <a href="https://dssg.resilienceatlas.org/map" target="_blank">Resilience Atlas</a>, and short descriptions of our other studies are available on the Vital Signs <a href="http://vitalsigns.org/blog/are-effects-extension-services-crop-productivity-moderated-farmers-education-attainment-results" target="_blank">blog</a>. 

<p>Since entering graduate school, I have also been affiliated with the <a href="http://www.comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/" target="_blank">Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP)</a>. As a member of the CCP team, I helped to build <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/" target="_blank">Constitute</a>, a search and visualization tool powered by CCP's data on the world's founding texts. I also helped to build a series of visualizations related to the project, which were displayed online and on-site at the <a href="http://billofrights.constitutioncenter.org/rights-interactive/constitutional-rights-origins-and-travels/" target="_blank">National Constitution Center</a> in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>You can find links to several of these projects in-text and through the pictures below. For information about ongoing work, please feel free to get in touch!</p>
